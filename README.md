# Laminoboost 

Memoization-based Scalable Laminography Reconstruction.

## Convergence
![Figure 1: Convergence](./images/curve.png)

**Figure 1:** The convergence is tested with the dataset (1k,1k,1k) and $\tau$ = 0.95. No additional iteration for convergence is required.


## Bandwidth 
![Figure 2: Bandwidth](./images/bandwidth_vs_node_number.png).

**Figure 1:** The bandwidth is test with dataset (1k,1k,1k) reconstruction and 1-16 nodes connected by slingshot11(Max Bandwidth 200Gbps). Each node is equipped with a single AMD EPYC 7543P processor featuring 32 Zen3 cores (64 hardware threads) operating at 2.8 GHz.
